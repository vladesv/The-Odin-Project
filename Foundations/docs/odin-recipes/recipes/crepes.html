    <p>Making homemade crêpes is easier than you think. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add flour and melted butter; whisk vigorously until batter is smooth and pourable.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
